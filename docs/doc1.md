## What is Check Yo Self CLI?

Check Yo Self CLI is a little tool to help you check the spelling and grammar of your markdown blog posts from the command line. It's based off this nifty little web app I built in React called [Check Yo Self](https://checkyoself.surge.sh/). While a web app is a great idea for regular users, I felt that I could have a way for a more experienced user to check their markdown right in their terminal. This is where Check Yo Self CLI comes in.
